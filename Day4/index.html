        <h1 style="text-align: center; display: block; margin-top:px; ">ABOUTUS</h1>
        <p> Perfumy is a term often used to describe products or scents that have a strong, noticeable fragrance, similar to perfume. It can refer to anything from cosmetics and skincare items to scented candles or even clothing that carries a distinctive aroma. The word is also sometimes used to describe the characteristic of a perfume that is particularly floral, sweet, or luxurious. In the world of perfumery, creating the perfect "perfumy" scent involves a careful balance of top, middle, and base notes. These layers work together to create a long-lasting impression. Top notes are the first to be detected and usually consist of fresh, citrusy, or fruity scents. Middle notes, also known as the heart, give the fragrance its characterâ€”often floral or spicy. Base notes are the foundation, offering depth with ingredients like musk, amber, or wood.Perfumy products are popular for their ability to evoke emotions, memories, and personal identity. Whether used in personal care or home environments, a well-crafted scent can uplift moods, enhance confidence, and create a lasting impression. The art of making something "perfumy" is both a science and an expression of style, making fragrances an essential part of everyday luxury.</p>
